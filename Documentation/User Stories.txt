BEDSIDE SYSTEM

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to add and remove modules to and from bedside systems, so that I can use only the modules I need for a particular patient. 
- Feature implemented as described
- A maximum of four modules can be installed into each bedside system (make configurable at startup)
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to interact with bedside systems to create monitors, configure modules and their corresponding min/max limits, view the current readings, and delete monitors which are no longer needed, in order to make sure that my patients are safe.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to reset alarms and warning lights from bedside systems, so that others know that incidents have been dealt with.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a bedside system, I need to periodically poll my modules, so that I can obtain up-to-date readings for use in the monitors.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a bedside system, I need to raise an alarm and a warning light when a monitor has detected a breach of the min/max limits of one of its modules, so that medical staff are aware that there is an incident.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a bedside system, I need to notify the control system when an alarm is raised, so that alarms can be seen from anywhere.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

CONTROL SYSTEM

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to interact with the control system to create monitors, configure modules and their corresponding min/max limits, view the current readings, and delete monitors which are no longer needed, in order to make sure that my patients are safe.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to reset alarms and warning lights from the control system, so that others know that incidents have been dealt with.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a medical staff member, I need to be able to log into stations and subscribe to pager/SMS notifications, so that I can monitor patients remotely and be more aware of raised alarms.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a consultant, I need to be able to log into stations and subscribe to email notifications, so that I can monitor patients remotely and be more aware of raised alarms.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a bedside system, I need to notify the control system when a software alarm is triggered, so that response time statistics can be generated and bed information can be shown on bay displays.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a control system, I need to display monitoring/alarm information about every bedside system, so that medical staff can keep an eye on patients from a distance.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a control system, I need to store any information I receive about alarm raises/resets, so that reports can be generated later and I can feed it to the displays.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary

As a control system, I need to store any information I receive about login/logouts, so that reports can be generated later.
- Feature implemented as described
- Both unit tests and integratation tests are written where necessary
